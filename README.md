## msgbsR: an R package to analyse methylation sensitive genotyping by sequencing (MS-GBS) data ###

Current data analysis tools do not fulfil all experimental designs. For example, GBS experiments using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes (REs), which is also known as methylation sensitive genotyping by sequencing (MS-GBS). msgbsR is an R package for the data analysis of MS-GBS experiments. Read counts and cut sites from a MS-GBS experiment can be read directly into the R environment from a sorted and indexed BAM file(s) to perform differential methylation analyses.
